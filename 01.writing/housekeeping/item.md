!!! Temporary Housekeeping Notice to be *Deleted* later

I've recently redid a huge amount of URLs in an attempt to have cleaner, less robotic seeming links. Some articles still have longer urls, but I tried to be as neat and human readable as I could.

All these URLs should have valid redirects from the old URLs they had. If you got a 404 error clicking a link, please contact me on Twitter or Bluesky or email and let me know. It is very important for me to try and preserve as many links as I can. If I still host the content, I want old links out in the wild to point to it.

I suspect these changes should be painless, but lemme know if anything gets weird.

I've also removed "Game Journal:" from the title of some older articles. No one should care. Now, Game Journal should ONLY refer to grab-bags and shorts, and not full, in depth write-ups.

*(There is not actually more to read, I'm just making sure it shows the whole post)*
