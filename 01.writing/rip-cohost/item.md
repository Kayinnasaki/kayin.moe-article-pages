RIP to a *real* Website.

While not my actual real [last post](https://cohost.org/Kayin/post/7932627-empty), emotionally my "final cohost post" was written days earlier. It's mirrored over [here](../cohost/post-chost), which brings me to the fact that there *is* a mirror. While the cohost page may stay up, redirecting to the Internet Archives's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), I have my favorite posts archived [over here](../cohost). 

I'm not going to dwell here on [tool tip="It's a HUGE tragedy"]what a tragedy[/tool] and loss it is that cohost couldn't survive. Instead I'm going to highlight some things I did there that I enjoy. Allow me to recommend a few posts.

## Pleasant and Useful

- **[Using CSS to make Discord Better](../cohost/discord-css)**, is probably one of the more useful things I put on that site. Just don't blame me if you get yourself banned!
- **[Getting Feedback is Hard and it's not because your Friends Hate You](../cohost/feedback)**, a write-up talking about fighting RSD style impulses and understanding why your friends might not be giving you as much feedback as you'd expect.
- **[Engage with Media but don't Overthink it!!](../cohost/engage-with-media)**, a super bare bones guide to being a more active participate in the media you enjoy.
- **[Swiss Format is Sick](../cohost/swiss-format)**, about how Swiss is great for running online tournaments and any online TO should at least try it once.

Some fun ones also include.

- **[10 Games to get to Know Me](../cohost/ten-games)**, which is exactly what it says on the tin.
- **[So you wanna display a Fuchsia pixel in the middle of a Screen?](../cohost/screens)**, which is a casual deep dive into the absurdity of display technologies.
- You can also check out the [**Wrestling**](../list/tag:Wrestling) tag, if you're that kind of freak.

## Me, Being a Hater

- **[Hate](../cohost/steam-trading-cards)**, a post about how much I despise Steam Trading Cards that borders on free verse poetry.
- **[Achievements are one of the Worst Things in Gaming that Didn't Have to Be](../cohost/achievements)**, a post about why I think Achievements were one of the big Unforced Errors of modern gaming.
- **[Stop Implementing Coyote Time](../cohost/stop-coyote-time)**, a [tool tip="... More like quarter. Maybe an EIGHTH joking"]half[/tool] joking post about why I hate how we force every game to have generous "Coyote Time" and how it leads to a weird airjumping arms race that is worse than the problem it was trying to solve.

I've also added a [Links and Friends](../links) section. If I know you and your work and you have a *88x31* icon, feel free to hit me up in all the normal places. Speaking of places to find me, besides the usual stuff linked on my sidebar *(which I will eventually have to update)*, here are a few new places you can find me.

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kayin.bsky.social)
- [Pillowfort](https://www.pillowfort.social/Kayin)
- [Dreamwidth](https://kayin.dreamwidth.org/)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@kayin)
  
We'll see which ones of these actually ends up working for me. Anyways, until next time...

*See you in Space, Eggbug.*
