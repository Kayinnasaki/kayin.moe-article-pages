Everyone who has read my writing knows I have no love in my heart for remakes and remasters. This though, comes from my personal goals and interests in playing games. I don't expect *or even want* everyone to share my priorities. This title is not meant to be a rude rhetorical, but a genuine question I want to explore.

Defining a remake is difficult. Something like **Final Fantasy 7 Remake** is fundamentally different from the **Demon's Souls** remake, which is again different to something like an HD collection. 

## "I've always meant to play this game, and the remake seems like a good time to catch up"

This isn't about **Silent Hill 2** but the timing isn't coincidental either. If I'm to be honest, the only Silent Hill game I ever played was [tool tip="In glorious, chunky, messy glory"]SH1[/tool]. I have no relationship with Silent Hill 2, outside the fact it's been on my ever present *mental list*. The Remake might seem like as good a time as any to *catch up*, but I frankly have no interest in it. I've heard more good than bad, second hand, off of twitter, but nothing anyone says changes one fundamental fact.

*The Silent Hill 2 Remake is not Silent Hill 2*

SH2 Remake apparently is a pretty substantive remake. If you play it, you haven't *caught up on Silent Hill 2*, you *played a different game*. That game could be good. In theory, it could be better. Transformative remakes and adaptations span all art. Few people know about 1960's Frank Sinatra movie, **Ocean's 11**, but most are at least familiar with the 2001 remake. Videogames complicate this though. [The Gaming Brit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sloxE1MsE_k) makes the point that while Disney's **The Little Mermaid** is an adaptation of a 1837 fairy tail, we don't treat the two as *the same* in the same way we do games. Granted, we muddy the lines.

Would I claim someone who played the Demon's Souls remake hasn't played Demon's Souls? [Despite my hatred](../demons-souls-remake) for it, *no*... It's tough, though. Outside of mechanical things, it'd be so hard to talk about a lot of stuff, down to even the mood and music. Would I say someone who played **Metal Gear Solid 2** and **3** through the HD collection didn't play the games? I might not prefer that choice, but certainly no. What about **Bionic Commando**, vs **Bionic Command: Rearmed**? Something that can both in some ways be a seeming better version of the original while at the same time being a fundamentally different experience. No, playing Rearmed doesn't count as playing the NES version of Bionic Commando... but nor does playing the NES version count as knowing anything about the [tool tip="Not even REMOTELY the same game"]*arcade version*[/tool].

### Digression about the artistic merits of Remakes

In modern gaming though we don't have as many situations like that. The Silent Hill 2 remake *has* to be respectful to the original. In some ways this seems like a good way, but it often limits these creations to being their own art. The NES is [tool tip="... Mostly because Nintendo forced their hand, but that's another story"]full of transformative titles[/tool], that did deep reinterpretations of the arcade originals, like **Rygar**, or **Ninja Gaiden**. The PC was full of examples like this too. **Wolfenstein: The New Order** exists culturally distinct from **Wolfenstein 3D**, but interestingly also the 2d **Castle Wolfenstein**. Wolf3d was, in a sense, an extremely substantive remake that supplanted the original.

Interesting too is **Metal Gear Sold**, a sequel, but a *mechanical retelling* of **Metal Gear 2**, a statement that feels wild until you play MG2. The radar, how stealth works, the type of puzzles, poly-alloy temperature sensitive keys. Like someone reviving an old franchise, Kojima took his best, old ideas and turned them into a new package. Despite this, MGS does not supplant MG2, even if it's a game designed to be able to stand on it's own.

These games each are supported by their history, but are allowed to stand on their own. This is something we don't afford many remakes and remasters and what's on the table to change is [tool tip="I knew the DeS Remake was cooked when they said the core was the untouchable gameplay but it was the graphics that were the problem"]seemly arbitrary[/tool].
