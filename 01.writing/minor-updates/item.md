Re-evaluating some decisions after the fall of cohost, and after seeing everyone's neocities pages, I decided to re-evaluate my front page. Instead of just assuming everyone who comes here knows who I am and having a kind of cold, but clean drop into a *blog roll* I decided it was better to have something more personal. This is a minor change, but I feel like it's a much larger *vibes* change, making it feel less than just a *feed*. It also lets me put everyone's cute **66x31** icons on my front page, which feels nice.

I also recently redid a huge amount of URLs in an attempt to have cleaner, less robotic seeming links. All these URLs should have valid redirects from the old URLs too. If you got a 404 error clicking a link, please contact me on Twitter or Bluesky or email and let me know. It is very important for me to try and preserve as many links as I can. If I still host the content, I want old links out in the wild to point to it.

I've also removed "Game Journal:" from the title of some older articles. No one should care, but it's use felt arbitrary. Now, Game Journal should ONLY refer to grab-bags and shorts, and not full, in depth write-ups.

Also thank you Camille for the heads up that the RSS feeds were broken due to a bug I introduced while starting these changes. I've modified things to make them work but it involved moving the RSS feeds. They SHOULD auto redirect, but if you have any problems, [tool tip="... My email link, which was ALSO broken until Camille pointed it out"]please tweet or email me[/tool].

**edit:** I moved the RSS feed AGAIN but this should be the last time. I got a better understanding of what's going on with things now with the rss plugin.
