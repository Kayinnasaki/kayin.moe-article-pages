## Article Archive for Type Checking

Articles off of https://kayin.moe/ Can be accessed on https://github.com/Kayinnasaki/kayin.moe-article-pages/

The purpose of this repository is to receive corrections and fix typos. Currently I'm not accepting anything like translations(I'd be maybe interested if someone wanted to do one for an article, but please contact me first). In particular, articles like [Reaction Speeds in Gaming](https://kayin.moe/reaction-speeds-in-gaming) could benefit far more than most of my other writing.

### Submission Guidelines

- Don't try to re-write me weird wack ass prose in a PR.
  * Keep any Pull Requests to simple typos, spelling mistakes, or minor grammatical issues.
  * If a sentence needs to be rewritten, I'll figure out how to do it.
* If a paragraph or line is too confusing, incoherent, or just plain wrong, file an issue.
  * You *can* suggest a specific rewrite.
  * Keep in mind I do have a *way* of typing, and will want to retain some of the voice.
  * ... I get a little too much sometimes though so suggesting I pump the breaks a little is welcome.
* If filing an PR is too complicated, file an issue.
* If using github is too complicated, just tweet me. 
  * Please be EXPLICIT about the typo. Don't send me a paragraph and say 'in here'.

* No unsolicited translations. Contact me first.
