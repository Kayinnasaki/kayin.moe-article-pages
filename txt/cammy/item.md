Moves
=====

Lights
------

**2LP an 5LP** Your 4 frame mash. Same range. Standing hits crouchers. pretzels is the same. SPick based on vibes and convenience. Your pressure could be like 70% these two moves if you wanted. Micro walk 5LP over and over. Be like Sophie. Be a bitch. **Key Move**

**5LK** 5F with great move. Your up-close footsie and whiff punish move. Catch people trying to walk away from your cute character. That said using this outside of combos and getting reward off of it is probably a bit tricky so I'd mostly focus on harassing with it.

If you're feeling spicy this _(and 2MK)_ are great for to swing just outside of whiff range in the hopes of catching a button. If you get comfortable finding this space you can safely buffer Spiral Arrow behind it, but if you misjudge the range and get blocked, you'll do the Spiral Arrow and get punished. _Important, but more advanced move to use well_

**2LK** Shorter range, not cancelable, but chainable with LP. So you can do stuff like _2LK 2LP -> special_. If you're doing stuff lights as oki you might as well start with one 2LK.

Mediums
-------

**5MP** 6F. Fast, barely minus on block, good range. Important normal while on offense. Can't be canceled, but hit confirmable with a link to 5LK. Great button to use during a drive rush, as it's +10 on hit and +3 on block. If a DR 5MP hits deep enough you get a **Strike/Throw/Shimmy** mixup and at farther range, you're still at a good range to hit 5LK or 5MP again (or just take a few steps and throw if they're respecting your pressure). _Key Move_

**2MP** 7F, adding one more frame for way more range and cancelablity. Can also link into 5LK but that extended range can make 5LK whiff. You can also just do it for the sake of doing it too that's cool! _Important, but maybe not as straight forward as I'd like. Mortar that fills in the space between other moves._

**5MK** Stand Kicky. Hits far. Be annoying with it. You're not going to get anything extra off of it, but who cares. Footsies normal.

**2MK** Toe Checker. Slightly shorter range, but cancelable. Do those out of range buffers trying to catch people. Use it to start a DRC and get in. Sophie likes to use this as a jump scare as a DR normal too, but getting reward off that is expensive. That said, a flying green 2MK is a scary thing! Technically hit confirmable, but don't try. _Key Normal_, though I feel like canceling off of it will get you in trouble a lot at first.

Heavies
-------

**5HP** a good fast disjointed nasty button that can single button hit confirm into other stuff... That said... it's still tough. This is probably the best button I'm going to tell you not to worry about. Mostly worry about it as a punish or in combos or something.

**2HP** Slow, but +1 on block!! We'll talk about that more later but that's good! also meatie! Mostly used for Oki and combos, but you can squeak this in on pressure if you're being greedy. **VERY KEY MOVE**.

**5HK** Like a big 5MK. Honestly I would just use 5MK until you feel like you need some added spice. Or maybe do the opposite. Maybe ignore 5MK and hit only this. Go with your heart.

**2HK** Sweeps are for professionals only. It's a _really_ good sweep, but using sweeps without eating shit is hard. Great hitbox.

Command Normals and Target Combos
---------------------------------

**4MP** Good, fast anti air, but will trade or outright lose to some stuff with beefier hitboxes. _Important, but you should try DPing instead when possible_. Works better for up deep AAs, but if they cross up you'll get 5MP instead.

**4HK** Combo filler.

**6HK** This is a big funny button that can be used as a counter poke or even as a shimmy. Mostly don't worry about it.

**4MP->HK** Combos only

**4HP->HK** Auto 3 hit. Gimmicks. Generally speaking, don't use this. Massively unsafe. Confirm window isn't too big and the reward isn't big enough to recommend. But you CAN knowledge people by doing a divekick off the second hit. Mashing beats all options besides maybe her super??? Super silly but you catch people sleeping you can EX divekick and end up +2 I guess. If you cancel into divekick most people won't have a big punish ready even if they catch you.

Air
---

idfk jump in with j.HP, unless their far then usine j.HK, unless they're also in the air, then use j.MK. One of these probably crosses up and oh it's j.LK okay cool. As you probably know j.MP can be special cancelable and that's cool but using that outside of combos seems too fancy for this guide!

Specials
--------

**Spiral Arrow** Generally, don't outside of combos. You CAN make the LK and MK ones safe with spacing and feel free to try. You can whiff punish with the LK and MK versions too? HK can be charged, but mostly for combos.

In combos it's notable that you get GREAT oki off of these (we'll get to that)! Also you can generally always cancel one strength higher than the button your leading with. So 5LK -> 236MK, or 2MP -> 236HK

**Cannon Spike** DP their ass. Lighter Buttons = Better AA, Heavier Buttons = More Daamge and Frame Advantage (not that the advantage should matter much). Midscreen You can drive rush in with something like 2MP for pressure but you won't get a ton off of it unless they don't block on wakeup. In the corner you can do whatever, basically. HK can be charged, but mostly for combos.

**Spin Knuckle** A safe cancel. Anti fireball, but slow and easy to make whiff. HP can be used as a turn stealer, leaving you at +3. Vulnerable on whiff. You can do some neat combos with these but they don't seem like you should worry about them. MP gives you in a **Strike/Throw/Shimmy** on a hit, and HP gives you a a combo (5LK into Spiral Arrow)

**Cannon Strike** Fuck up peoples AAs. Good but hard to aim. Gotta snatch those toes to be plus. Use EX to gain leeway. I like using MK mostly for toe-hunting.

**Hooligan** idfk ask Sophie. Probably important to mix up with Spin Knuckle. Worth playing around with in neutral or in cancels. If the hooligan itself doesn't get stuffed, you're pretty much safe. The overhead is like -2, the slide (which takes eternity), is +2 and if you're using hooligan from a distance, cannon strike seems easier to make plus due to the low angle. Throw is always just a nice, simple option too.

Hooligan seems like Cammy's spice. Don't worry too much about it right away but don't completely ignore it. Oh also when you charge HK Hooligan all the followups are juiced???? Idk how practical that is but take what you can get.

**Throw** throwing is of course good but you reset to neutral mid screen. In the corner you can throwloop and associated other mixups.

Supers
------

Level 3 is a gun

Okay lets make a PLAN
=====================

NEUTRAL
-------

LP is your mash button! 5MP, 2MP, and 2MK are your footsie buttons. Occasionally jump in with j.HP or Dive kick... or DR in. The goal is to _make contact_ to either establish pressure or get a knockdown into spiral arrow to get oki. Tapping people with buttons like 5MK or 5MK is good to try and make them do more things to open themselves up or work your way in.

**5MP** _(or jump-ins)_ needs to hit, but can convert to an advantageous situation without resources using _5MP 5LK 235MK_

**DR 5MP** costs one bar and gives a combo in hit and a mixup on block. You might have to kinda predict which one you're going to get but there are safe options that kinda cover everything

**2MK/2MP DRC** Costs 3 bars, but buys you in. DRC into 5MP or 2HP leaves you hecka plus and in pressure/mixup range. If it hits? all the better.

Sprinkle in some wild options. Do a hooligan! Drive Impact. Things like a plus Dive kick or a **Blocked HP Spinknuckle** (or hitting MP Spinknuckle) can also start offense, as is a well spaced cannon strike.

Strike throw in SF -- Mix without an Overhead
---------------------------------------------

Lets start with the most IDEAL situation You did a DR 5MP as Oki. This is the In-Your Face **+3 Situation**. The **Strike/Throw/Shimmy** deal. at +3, a Throw will beat a reversal 4F button.

**Throw** beats their mashes, blocks, and parries. Neutral on throwbreaks, delay break, loses to reversals, and backdashes.

**Strike** 5MP or 2LP(to be safe) beats their throw breaks and mashes, neutral on block and delay techs, loses the Perfect Parry and reversals.

**Shimmy** Just hold back and then hit a button (5MP or 2HP are great here! Beats both throw break timings (potentially, early tech might get to block depending). Neutral with them mashing on wakeup (you're holding back so you're blocking). Also can bait reversals for the same reason. Can lose to a properly delayed mash or wakeup low.

There are other options here like delayed button or delay throw and all that but these 3 are the foundation. In the corner these options can keep looping into each other. Same with mid screen, ignoring throw. So when do you get this situation?

**Deep DR 5MP or 2HP** Usually as oki.

**A blocked jump in** Gotta manually time it but jump ins leave you like +5 to +10 or something. Just gotta find the delay that makes it work. (you can use the frame data bar. You wanna see a gap of 1-3 blank bars on your opponents bar between the jump in and whatever you do after)

**MP Spin Knuckle hits** +3 and point blank. You can make this happen by comboing off of 5HP into spin knuckle.

**Corner Throw and Spiral Arrow Oki** Not LITERALLY +3 situations, but the same rules apply. Better, in a lot of ways. Tricky because you have to time it though. if you wanna shimmy you need to walk up to throw range and either walk back or stop just out of range. **Criticial**. We'll get into Cannon Spike Oki a little bit more later.

Then you have the **+1/+2** or **Spaced Situation** where you don't have enough frames, or maybe you're like +5 but you gotta walk forward to get the throw. An _imperfect_ mixup.

The biggest thing here is mash beats throw. Since you either need to walk forward or because your advantage is too low, you have to lean more on **Strike** to minimize risk. Once you establish a pattern, you can start trying to get in throws. On some characters and spaces you can also counterpoke. Characters with shot jabs might whiff if you don't go in for throw, so you can blow them up. Or rebuy pressure! Do 2LP 2LP and when it's clear they blocked, DRC, do 5MP and get the +3 Situation.

### Spiral Arrow Oki

This kinda brings these two concepts together. After a Spiral Arrow you have enough time to dash forward once to nullify their backroll. Then you can proceed to **Strike/Throw/Shimmy**. But your strike is a little more interesting because you can 2HP as your strike, and if they block you're still +1 and at a spacing where it's easy for them to whiff a counterpoke. 2LP is again your best option most of the time but with a little conditioning you can start throwing or doing other buttons or whatever. Then if you hit? Back into Spiral Arrow, dash, repeat. Once they're in the corner, throw is equally as strong and you grind them to dirt.

So in Summation
---------------

5MP, 2MP, and 2MK. Mash 2LP. Combo into Spiral Arrow when you can. Do 2HP meatie sometimes when you can. DR 5MP. Okay but what do you do on hits???

Combos
======

I'll try and specify how ""optimal"" these combos are because some of them won't really be at all, but I'll try and give alternatives or more info when I can. But in general, when in doubt? **5LK 236MK**... Almost any link can be replaced with _5LK 236MK_ so if you get lost just autopilot there.

Basic Combos
------------

These are important. Worth playing around with all of them.

**2LP 2LP 2LP 236MK** Your true BnB. Mash that jab and just do a spiral arrow! This seems simple and boring but you see real cammys do this all the time. You can mix and match 2LP and 5LPs any way you want. _2LK 2LP ->_ is also useful!

With range, you might might only get two hits to confirm instead of 3. You can do something like _2LP 2LP 5LK 236MK_ to get a little more range, but 2LP -> 5LK is a link. It's SF6 1frame link which means it's 5 frames. You might find it easy or hard, but it's worth playing with to see.

**5MP 2LK 236MK** The link here is kinda late which can make it hard to mash out but it also makes it really easy to confirm!

**2HP 2MP 236HK** Like the same thing, just with 2HP for Oki. Same easy confirm, sameish link. Higher damage Spiral Arrow but if you wanna keep things simple in your mind you can just do 236MK for both. 236HK gives slightly more frame advantage though that can make you +3 instead of +1 during Spiral Arrow Oki (2HP will hit very meatie) but like... you gotta be comfortable doing the oki tight before that matters.

You can do both of the above combos off a jump in, though j.# -> 2HP needs a deep j.HP. j.HK will hit later but will always give you enough frames to hit the 2HP. I would recommend doing a jump in into **5MP 2LK 236MK** at first just because it's less to think about.

_It's worth it to work on these links!!_

Counter Hit and Footsies Shit
-----------------------------

These are situational. Don't worry about all of these, but pick one or two things to play with until it becomes second nature then do something else

**2MP/2MK/5HP 236HK** Again, buffer at whiff range and if they stick out a button maybe you'll clip em and automatically get the special! _This is tricky, so don't stress out over this, but try it out_

**CH 2LP 5MP 2LK 236MK** OR **CH 2LP 2MP 236HK** The _2LK 236MK_ does slightly more damage, has more time to confirm, but is harder and gives slightly weaker Oki. _2MP 236HK_ is a shorter confirm window but is _much_ easier to do in my opinion. Play around with both and pick one.

Use either of these during oki when you're mashing 2LP. If they get hit it's probably because they hit a button.

**CH 2MP 2MP 236HK** Sometimes just do 2MP up close twice and oh hey it comboed cause they hit something sweet, knock em down. This is just a way to convert random pokes and pressure into damage.

**PC 5MP(or 2HP) 5HP 236HK Or 214MP or 623\[HK\]** Your Shimmy combo when you punish counter their delay tech. You can also be SNEAKY and do 5MP 214MP to get a little shimmy situation again. The Held DP version hits like a truck and is a great cancel route for comboing into level 3 (though it's kinda tricky).

DRs, DRC Extensions, and Spending Meter
---------------------------------------

Spending meter!! It's good to DRC and figure out if you hit or not after the fact! I wouldn't try and confirm a hit before throwing

**DR 5MP 5MP 5LK 236MK** Frametraps on block and gives you two 5MPs to realize it hit.

**DR 2MK 5LK 236MK** 2MK jumpscare. Whiffs at max range though. You need to DRC 2MK to get more and you end up spending 4 bars. Sophie likes it but...........
