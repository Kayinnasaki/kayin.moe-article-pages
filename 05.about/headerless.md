Hi, I’m Kayin! I’m a game developer with particular interest in old games, platformers and difficulty. My favorite part of game development is level design so I’m a big sucker for Metroidvanias and Masocore games. I sometimes write about game design, but I mostly write about the games I’ve played these days.


I have my pronouns set to _**He/She/They**_. If that’s confusing to you, _you totally don’t have to worry about it_. _**He**_ and_ **Him**_ are _always fine_, but sometimes people might use She! Feel free to refer to me as you like! You’re never going to be wrong or upset me I promise! No matter what, I’m still just me!

I’ve also been using the name **Kay** as an exclusively feminine nickname. You’re free to use it as you like! Kayin to me is more gender neutral than masculine so you can use Kayin without any gender implications. It’s a name I chose and is very important to me. I won’t ever be sad hearing it. But if you want to be explicit in _girling_ me... or just like the name better, feel free to use it!

My favorite old games are **Super Metroid**, **Castlevania 3**, and **Bionic Commando**, but I love weird titles like **Shadow Tower: Abyss** or **E.V.O.: The Theory of Evolution**

Some of my favorite modern games include games like **Dark Souls**, and **Bayonetta** as well as indie games like **Celeste**,** Shenzhen I/O**, and** Undertale**.

I also like a lot of weird games like flight sims and skateboarding games. I’ve spent a lot of time flying around in **IL 2-Sturmovik** and skating around in games like **Session**. I’m also a big fan of fighting games like **Guilty Gear** and **Street Fighter** and can definitely play Gear at a pretty competitive level!

I write a lot about game design a lot on bluesky twitter! You can follow me there, but be warned, I tweet about a lot of other things too. I wish I could say Pro Wrestling and Fighting Games was the worst of it, but it’s the easiest way to get in touch! Just beware all the other trashy stuff!

Speaking of Fighting Games, I stream on twitch fairly regularly! As of the time of this writing it’s mostly **Guilty Gear Xrd: Rev 2** but check my [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/kayinnasaki) for the current schedule!

You can also email me at **KayinWorks@gmail.com**, but if it’s business, make your pitch good, because I throw most of that junk right in the trash!
