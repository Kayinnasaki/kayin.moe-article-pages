I shared this image of Kairi and Utami on Cohost and got asked to share more, so...
<hr>

Okay so we have **Kairi** ~~<strike>*Hojo*</strike>~~ ~~<sub>*Sane*</sub>~~, One of the so called "Three Daughters of Stardom", or one of the three wrestlers who carried the company during its early years. A quick rundown.

![](kairi.jpg?lightbox)

- The Pirate Princess
- Really good at crying
- like *SO good* at crying
- Big Mom Energy. Loved by al.
- Went to WWE for like 5 years
- Small girl with Big Fight
- Incredible elbow drop
- Wrestling style best described as "Ragged, emotional screaming"

Kairi came back to Stardom after years and was competing in a tournament for the new IWGP Women's Championship. There, she did battle with one of the other Daughters, the only one not to leave for WWE, **Mayu Iwatani**

- The Icon of Stardom
- Disaster
- Original War Noodle
- Bad at everything but pro wrestling
- Put all her stat points into it
- Kissed a girl to learn how to do a Moonsault
- Kinda the company protagonist but also kinda a shitty leader??
- Huge goofball who gets violently scary and serious during big matches.
- Has no bones

A former social recluse and dropout who lived in some weird old dude with a hat's house for awhile to become a pro wrestler. Beat up after years of carrying the company after Kairi and Io Shirai left (the 3rd "Daughter"), Mayu has been taking it easy to recover for a good while. But she wanted about to just let Kairi come back and win some new belt after she'd stayed behind to keep this place alive.

Anyways they beat the shit out of each other and Kairi wins

After an emotional parting in the ring, Kairi goes back for the press conference, where she is confronted by **Utami Hayashishita**

- Futch
- Top
- Made me question my gender and sexuality at the same time
- Kinda a bad girlfriend *(Sorry Saya)*
- One of the leading wrestlers in Stardom's "New Generation"
- Either looks like a barbarian queen or a fuckboy prince
- Either look makes me sweaty
- Big Tall Strong Girl
- Probably thinks she's the leader of Queen's Quest, but everyone in Queens Quest seems to think that
- OH YEAH SHE COMES OUT WITH A FUCKING ROSE AND GIVES IT TO A GIRL IN THE CROWD LIKE COME ON THATS SO GAY GIMME A ROSE UTAMI PLEASE
- Got kissed by a scary MMA lady who was *like pfft look at this sapphic poser, lemme show you how to intimidate a girl--*

Utami is an incredible wrestler who has only been wrestling for 3 years. She spent a lot of the early pandemic on top of the company, but has taken a bit of a back seat of late. Seeing her chance to strike, she pops up at the press conference to establish dominance, grabbing Kairi's collar.

... But Kairi is used to handling uppity tops, and after an understandable moment up *hrrkk~!*, just chills out and goes like "Yeah hun, I'll fight whenever, it's cool" like you think you're the first girl to ~~point a gun at me~~ grab me by my collar???

Utami responds by pounding a beer, to save face and prove she's still a Cool Kid.
