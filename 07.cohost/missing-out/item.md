You're missing out!!!

I hate this phrase. Like okay not all the time -- sometimes you can legitimately miss out on something. A party, a convention, an MMO that died, a super secret limited Movie Screening. But most media isn't so time sensitive and... even if it was?

I've yelled about people being too attached the the zeitgeist for years, but it came up again talking a friend. Said friend was trying to get me to watch a well regarded show, by a well regarded studio... of an IP I absolutely detest. "But it's so good! You're missing out!"

I have only so many hours on this hell hole of a planet. I'm ALWAYS missing out. We all are. We will never experience all the Good Things, and even if we could somehow manage it, is trying to OPTIMIZE YOUR MEDIA CONSUMPTION TO MAXIMIZE QUALITY really a way of living worth striving for? Is trying to enjoy something that *isn't really for you* because *it's good* a better use of your time than diving into things you figure you're going to like?

If I'm always missing out, then I'm, in a different way, never missing out... as long as I'm doing things I enjoy. No piece of media is SO GOOD that you have to engage with it.

Also since it's come up a few times, lemme just say, I still think it's good to push your comfort zone and explore. I love finding weird new things I didn't know I'd like. I don't want to write something that can misinterpreted as "Don't try new things". But try the weird thing your friend suggested cause you're like 'huh what??' and not not cause they're trying to stoke your FOMO.

Or don't. Cause I'm also not saying you have to. If you have enough gay girl media stocked up that you can survive the apocalypse, who cares? Sure you'll miss out on stuff, but again, *you're always missing out*, so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

How much you value exploration in your media consumption is a personal choice, but the point is, *either way*, **don't let people blackmail you with FOMO!!!!** If you're gonna do that shit, do that shit on your own terms! üò§
