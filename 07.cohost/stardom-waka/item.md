Waka Tsukiyama, being loomed over by a disappointed Tam Nakano. The tag team champions had just lost a 3 v 2 handicap match, because Waka Tsukiyama has never won a match. The handicap was practically for the 2 person team. She has never been on the winning side of a tag, 6 woman, 8 woman, whatever. She has never been involved a draw. In fact, I'm not sure there is a match that Waka has been in since joining Stardom where she was not the one to be pinned or submitted.  In her 114 matches in Stardom, Waka Tsukiyama has been pinned or submitted 114 times. At least you never entered a tournament and went **0-114**.

Waka Tsukiyama is the best loser in professional wrestling.

She's awkward, insecure, can't dance in a group of ex idols, to the point where she's given up and just runs away. She feels like she can't fit in. [Her theme song can't decide what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJrv0vO45ao). But she goes and goes and goes, and giving it her all, screaming her heart at, going from a nerd to something vicarious.  She has passion and drive, just no Ws

And now with three months left to get a win before Tam kicks her out of Cosmic Angels, can Waka finally shine?
